       "      <td>Subject vehicle was a 2009 Ford Escape with 74,123 miles. Driving the vehicle the front passenger lower control arm separated from the k-frame/cradle causing the vehicle to lose control.  Loss of steering was experienced as well as tire lock up from the front tire lodging against the back of the fender. The CV shaft also separated during the failure resulting in loss of transmission engagement. There was no warning prior to the event, the failure was sudden and immediate. The loss of vehicle control was extreme. Failure is identical to RCRIT-14V165-9596 for the 01-04 Escapes.  The reason the recall was only isolated to the 01-04 Escapes is unknown. In my opinion, whatever PCA actions or supplier related issues identified by Ford Motor Company during the prior recall investigation to support the recall only affecting 01-04 model years was either incomplete or inaccurate.   The frame rust through condition extends beyond the model years listed in the recall and was not resolved as shown by subsequent failures on vehicles outside of the recall model year window.  No mechanism was put in place to prevent the control arm separation in the later model year Escapes to prevent the same safety issue from occurring. I was unable to obtain a front cradle from a local salvage yard that did not exhibit perforation present or starting supporting this condition is occurring on all model year Escapes from 2001 to 2012 in corrosion prone areas.  The recall should be extended to all model years involved to prevent potential accidents.</td>\n",

       "CDESCR             Subject vehicle was a 2009 Ford Escape with 74,123 miles. Driving the vehicle the front passenger lower control arm separated from the k-frame/cradle causing the vehicle to lose control.  Loss of steering was experienced as well as tire lock up from the front tire lodging against the back of the fender. The CV shaft also separated during the failure resulting in loss of transmission engagement. There was no warning prior to the event, the failure was sudden and immediate. The loss of vehicle control was extreme. Failure is identical to RCRIT-14V165-9596 for the 01-04 Escapes.  The reason the recall was only isolated to the 01-04 Escapes is unknown. In my opinion, whatever PCA actions or supplier related issues identified by Ford Motor Company during the prior recall investigation to support the recall only affecting 01-04 model years was either incomplete or inaccurate.   The frame rust through condition extends beyond the model years listed in the recall and was not resolved as shown by subsequent failures on vehicles outside of the recall model year window.  No mechanism was put in place to prevent the control arm separation in the later model year Escapes to prevent the same safety issue from occurring. I was unable to obtain a front cradle from a local salvage yard that did not exhibit perforation present or starting supporting this condition is occurring on all model year Escapes from 2001 to 2012 in corrosion prone areas.  The recall should be extended to all model years involved to prevent potential accidents. \n",

On Tuesday, July 25th, 2023, my car was completely dead, and I had to jump start the car to drive into work. My sound returned to my car, and I was able to drive to work. However, three warnings popped up my dashboard and my FordPass application. The first is an orange wrench, indicating a powertrain malfunction/reduced power. A second warning indicating a High-Voltage Battery Warning, and an engine   \n",

I relayed these warnings to my service advisor at the dealership this morning, who stated that he would look at seeing how the ACM was coming along and would get back to me soon. It has been several hours and I have heard nothing back. I am worried about what may come of my car and I haven't been told to bring it in.   \n",
       "12    My instrument cluster/panel went out on my car. I know I have a 2014 but my car only has 89,000 miles on it. I cannot imagine that something as important as an instrument cluster/panel was made to last under 100,000 miles let alone ever. So I looked for a recall and was excited to know that I would not have to pay for such an expensive repair. It was short lived however when I realized that my vehicle having a manufacture date of 02/12/2014 was not included in the recall which is for May 2014 - July 2015.   \n",

Seriously this is unbelievable to me. I had to pay $1,130.18 to fix this and I can't believe that others have not had the same problem.   \n",
       "14       My check engine light has come on four (4) seperate times, after being serviced three (3) times. All of which have been by a ford certified dealership. My rear brakes were making noise the week the new car was purchased. I notified to associate who sold me the car from a ford certified dealer and he made up an invalid excuse. I’ve had my car serviced 3 times for the service alert and within 2 weeks of it being serviced and the issues being fixed, it starts again resulting in my service light coming on.   \n",

    "New text mining techniques can now be applied leveraging existing text embedding vectors (or create them implicitly from the original text) unlocking the semantic understanding of text data for text mining tasks like text document classification. Thus elevating a classic task from linguistic text understanding to understanding the real natural language context of documents for greatly improved results. This new technique in SAP HANA Cloud Predictive Analysis Library for advanced text mining builds on the concept of approximate neares neighbor search, thus also adressing larger scale scenarios. The advanced text mining function is explained with more detail in the following blog post [New information retrieval techniques in SAP HANA Cloud using BM25 and ANNS for Advanced Text Mining](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/new-information-retrieval-techniques-in-sap-hana-cloud-using-bm25-and-anns/ba-p/13958729)."

       "      <td>WHY I AM SUBMITTING THIS COMPLAINT: I am writing to you upon the advice of the CA Attorney General's office. Their guidance was in response to a question I submitted on their web about safe and legal towing with the Model Y factory-installed towing package.   PROBLEM:  Risk of silent brake controller failure.   VEHICLES IMPACTED Model Y's with the Lithium Ion low voltage battery &amp; towing trailers 1500 lbs or more.   TECHNICAL ISSUES: The lithium Ion low-voltage battery operates at 15.5v, out of the normal 12v operating range. The wiring harness sends 15.5 v to the brake controller. Brake controllers connected to the Model Y towing harness do not throw an error. High voltage through a 12 v brake controller may result in unexpected brake controller failure per controller manufacturer's support teams.   Tesla disconnected the 12v aux power to the 7-pin towing connector. This power is used for RF trailer brake controllers. RF brake controllers don't get the required power. RF Brake controllers will throw an error &amp; the driver knows the brake system isn't connected correctly.  WHY DO I KNOW THIS? I bought the Model Y to tow my 2,000 lb teardrop trailer w/ a Prodigy/Tekonsha RF Brake controller. When I attempted to connect &amp; verify the rig was in spec, I discovered there was no power to the 7-pin plug. While troubleshooting, I found a Twitter post that described the problem, said Tesla disconnected the power &amp; there would be a retrofit in mid-2022. See attached.  ATTEMPTED RESOLUTION I've worked with Tesla Rocklin CA for a year. They submitted cases, escalated, and even unsuccessfully tried to connect a 24v controller. A fix isn't hard. I've heard corp. didn't expect people to tow.  COMMUNICATION: To my knowledge, there's been no communication to affected owners or to brake controller manufacturers.   NO FIX PLANNED Tesla Corp. doesn't intend to fix it or communicate to owners. See attached.  ACTION NEEDED People towing may be at risk of silent brake controller failure.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Tesla does not provide power to the Aux pin on the standard 7 pin connector for towing. This means that the vehicle will not keep a 12V battery on a trailer charged up at all times. In case of a breakaway situation, there will be no power to the brakes and thus the trailer will not stop safely.  Tesla changed to a 16V battery and has refused to step down the voltage for towing purposes. This is extremely dangerous when they advertise the Model Y and X as towing up to 3500 and 5000 lbs respectively and do not advertise the fact (outside the manual, where it must be inferred) that there is no power on the Aux pin. The 7 pin connector is a standard and Tesla is not adhering to it.</td>\n",

During this time, the onboard hazard lights were activated, and no other vehicle systems besides the standard interior features were active.  The low voltage battery died within 35 minutes of the high voltage battery. After the low voltage battery died, we were left on the side of the highway at 4am with no active hazard lights, the emergency vehicle door openers were required to be used, however, the windows were rendered unusable, so the doors could not be effectively shut without risking damage to the windows.   Having zero hazard or external lighting emitting from the vehicle after just 35 minutes at 4am on a dark stretch of highway put us in an extremely dangerous situation, and in our opinion, the hazards should have functioned for at least 2-3 hours.   The vehicle has since been repurchased from the manufacturer as a lemon due to other unrelated issues.    \n",

The information screen displayed various error messages regarding battery and drive system. The stop was abrupt and we could have been seriously injured in busy traffic. This was a scary experience. The car had 260 miles range in the battery and no prior warnings/ messages indicating any problem.  We called 911 and Tesla roadside assistance for help. San Ramon PD showed up and blocked the lane to avoid someone hitting our car. They had the car towed to the nearest Tesla Service Center in Dublin, CA. While waiting for the tow truck, we attempted to restart the car and computer system two times but the car did not go into \"Drive\" position to be moved. The service center is diagnosing the problem and have informed us that it could be a problem with the motor or drive terrain or inverter of the car. All these are major and crucial components on the car for safe and normal operation. Failure of any of these is catastrophic and can be fatal on freeway speeds or local roads if someone is following too closely and the car stops abruptly. We usually have kids in the car and this is a scary situation to imagine. This needs to be investigated in more detail by someone to find out how many card suffer this fate and how many accidents/ fatalities have been caused by something like this.    \n",

       "4  WHY I AM SUBMITTING THIS COMPLAINT: I am writing to you upon the advice of the CA Attorney General's office. Their guidance was in response to a question I submitted on their web about safe and legal towing with the Model Y factory-installed towing package.   PROBLEM:  Risk of silent brake controller failure.   VEHICLES IMPACTED Model Y's with the Lithium Ion low voltage battery & towing trailers 1500 lbs or more.   TECHNICAL ISSUES: The lithium Ion low-voltage battery operates at 15.5v, out of the normal 12v operating range. The wiring harness sends 15.5 v to the brake controller. Brake controllers connected to the Model Y towing harness do not throw an error. High voltage through a 12 v brake controller may result in unexpected brake controller failure per controller manufacturer's support teams.   Tesla disconnected the 12v aux power to the 7-pin towing connector. This power is used for RF trailer brake controllers. RF brake controllers don't get the required power. RF Brake controllers will throw an error & the driver knows the brake system isn't connected correctly.  WHY DO I KNOW THIS? I bought the Model Y to tow my 2,000 lb teardrop trailer w/ a Prodigy/Tekonsha RF Brake controller. When I attempted to connect & verify the rig was in spec, I discovered there was no power to the 7-pin plug. While troubleshooting, I found a Twitter post that described the problem, said Tesla disconnected the power & there would be a retrofit in mid-2022. See attached.  ATTEMPTED RESOLUTION I've worked with Tesla Rocklin CA for a year. They submitted cases, escalated, and even unsuccessfully tried to connect a 24v controller. A fix isn't hard. I've heard corp. didn't expect people to tow.  COMMUNICATION: To my knowledge, there's been no communication to affected owners or to brake controller manufacturers.   NO FIX PLANNED Tesla Corp. doesn't intend to fix it or communicate to owners. See attached.  ACTION NEEDED People towing may be at risk of silent brake controller failure.    \n",

This means that the vehicle will not keep a 12V battery on a trailer charged up at all times. In case of a breakaway situation, there will be no power to the brakes and thus the trailer will not stop safely.  Tesla changed to a 16V battery and has refused to step down the voltage for towing purposes. This is extremely dangerous when they advertise the Model Y and X as towing up to 3500 and 5000 lbs respectively and do not advertise the fact (outside the manual, where it must be inferred) that there is no power on the Aux pin. The 7 pin connector is a standard and Tesla is not adhering to it.  "
