Paula is really in love with classmate Sam Freeman (Ron Howard), an environmental research major, however, her father dismisses him as a \"fortune hunter,\" which they dispute. Bigby yells at Sam to leave, and while he tries to defend himself, Paula tells him to go wait for her outside. Bigby tells Paula that he is running for governor and wants her to cooperate. However, Paula dismisses Collins as a \"flake,\" and tells her parents that she won't marry him and will elope with Sam to Las Vegas. Bigby threatens to disinherit her and take away her sports car (that she had bought with her own money) if she disobeys him. Paula goes to her room and escapes through the window, stealing her parents, Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and hitting the road with Sam, beginning a wild explosive car chase and race towards Las Vegas. Bigby calls his associate Ned Slinker (played by Ron Howard's real-life father Rance), asking him to bring back Paula and the Rolls-Royce, and to have Sam incarcerated, without involvement of police and news media. Priscilla gets a call from Collins, who is currently in a stable playing polo, and tells him Paula ran off. Enraged, Collins smashes the phone and takes off in his car. After crashing it, he steals another car from a nearby dealership to continue the chase. His mother Vivian (Marion Ross, Ron Howard's co-star on Happy Days), after being informed of it by the police, decides to go after him herself before the police could arrest him.''',\n",
